## Adam Gamble's Portfolio!

Welcome to my Github portfolio site! I'm new to Github so still trying 
to get used to everything, but please enjoy! :grin:. I'm a new and up 
coming Web Developer from the UK, everything I learn, I try to implement 
into my Portfolio Project as practice, and sometimes just look for 
inspiration, implement what I like, and try to understand how it works. 
Hopefully there will be alot more Javascript / jQuery involved in the 
coming weeks / months.

Enjoy! and any advice / criticism is always welcomed! :grin:
